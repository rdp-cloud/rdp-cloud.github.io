### Attendees (19/20)

- Certification was a priority for a small portion of the participants early in the session however interest grew over the 3 days.
- A majority of attendees were new to AWS.
- One partner (VIX) had a strong presence on the course and sent a whole load of developers. This skewed the conversations a little from the usual architectural focus but the enterprise architects from RIO, Kinetic and AWS brought it back in line.
- 1 attendee, Ryan Strauch, excused himself from the course during the first break on the first day due to ill health.
- **Matt Tuohy** from the AWS Perth office displayed **exceptional** *bias for action* and *dive deep* when, following a general discussion around limiting resource creation based on budget, spent the next little while hammering out a POC using Lambda, IAM and Cloudwatch billing alerts that re-actively shutdown instances that were created once a predefined budget had been reached. Then proceeded to demo the solution to the class.

### Delivery Observations
No problems with the delivery. Differences between console and lab guide still end up in mild confusion. Required lab updates have been previously submitted to carriculum.

Poor wireless/internet connectivity hampered the delivery and labs.

Andy Meakin dropped in on Friday to say hello and spend a bit of one on one time with a couple of the attendees, notably Grey from VIX and John from Computercare.

### LMS Observations
LMS was well behaved for this course. I delayed signing everyone in until after the first break. This meant that I had to go  through instructions only once. Also I could walk all the partners through the APN sign up process. Still sucked up 15 minutes but it was a productive 15 minutes.  

### Roster Adjustments
This section details any adjustments (walk-in's, incomplete, withdrawals etc.) to the official roster.

### Notable Discussions
**[Betts Group]** Are moving their web assets to AWS and are looking for opportunities move as many workloads as possible. Anthony is a one man IT band and has been working with a partner to design their first deployment. He was enthusiastic to return to the design review next week with this weeks perspectives.

**[Woodside]** James Baxter expressed dissatisfaction with their current design and implementation provided by a third party with regard to a recent project coming over to AWS. I would recommend a follow up from AWS.\

**[RIO]** Lots of discussions between Matt from AWS and Jean-Michel from RIO.

### Evaluations ( 15/19 )
Tough crowd on the points scoring (well, one particularly tough who decided to drop in a whole bunch of 1’s.)

I just don't know how John Jr manages to please all the peoples all the time???

Classroom  **4.40**

----
- Very well structured course - Rodney was knowledgeable on topic and he played good music too!
- Good course. Great insight in the AWS world.
- The catering was average. The days were long, some sugar hits at morning and afternoon tea would be useful to maintain functional powers...
- At some point in the chain between myself/ my employer and the venue something was broken: I was never asked about my dietary preferences and thus had to eat out/was restricted to the one item without meat. Not sure who dropped the ball here and I will also be following up with the responsible person at work
- The food supplied could be improved. There should have been morning and afternoon tea supplied. The lunch provided was limited and should be increased.
- More time to do labs again out of hours would be good.
- Only able to print 10 pages at a time is painful. Gilmore VitalSource Bookshelf webpage locked up several times.
- This is the second time I have attended training here and both times wireless connectivity disrupted lab activities creating pressure and stress around completing these activities.


Having said that, I just got this email in…

    Hi Rodney
    I just sat and passed the Solutions Architect exam. It may have had something to do with a great instructor.
    Cheers

### Location and Facilities ( Cliftons Perth )

#### Internet
Wireless was poor and intermittent. The staff were responsive when queried about the connectivity and provided a second access point. As noted in the feedback this seems to be a recurring deficiency of the Cliftons facility.
Room		Good lighting

#### A/V
Good projector. Audio provided by little speakers on instructors desk. This can be improved.

#### Catering
Catering was just enough, perhaps a little shy on amount. Biscuits and coffee were not enough as expressed in the feedback.
